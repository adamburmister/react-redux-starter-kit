Its purpose is not to dictate your project structure or to demonstrate a complete sample application, but to provide a set of tools intended to make front-end development robust, easy, and, most importantly, fun. Check out the full feature list below!\r\n\r\nTable of Contents\r\n-----------------\r\n1. [Requirements](#requirements)\r\n1. [Features](#features)\r\n1. [Getting Started](#getting-started)\r\n1.

Use `npm start` to spin up the dev server.\r\n* Compiling the application to disk? Use `npm run compile`.\r\n* Deploying to an environment? `npm run deploy` can help with that.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** This package makes use of [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) to improve your debugging experience. For convenience, all of messages are prefixed with `app:*`. If you'd like to to change what debug statements are displayed, you can override the `DEBUG` environment variable to `app:*` via the CLI (e.g. `DEBUG=app:* npm start`) or update the `~/.env` file.\r\n\r\nGreat, now that introductions have been made here's everything in full detail:\r\n\r\n* `npm start` - Spins up Koa server to serve your app at `localhost:3000`. HMR will be enabled in development.\r\n* `npm run tsd` - Install all TypeScript definitions required by the project.\r\n* `npm run compile` - Compiles the application to disk (`~/dist` by default).\r\n* `npm run dev:nw` - Same as `npm start`, but opens the redux devtools in a new window.\r\n* `npm run dev:no-debug` - Same as `npm start` but disables redux devtools.\r\n* `npm run test` - Runs unit tests with Karma and generates a coverage report.\r\n* `npm run test:dev` - Runs Karma and watches for changes to re-run tests; does not generate coverage reports.\r\n* `npm run deploy`- Runs linter, tests, and then, on success, compiles your application to disk.\r\n* `npm run lint`- Lint all `.js` files.\r\n* `npm run lint:fix` - Lint and fix all `.js` files. [Read more on this](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface.html#fix).\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** Deploying to a specific environment? Make sure to specify your target `NODE_ENV` so webpack will use the correct configuration. For example: `NODE_ENV=production npm run compile` will compile your application with `~/build/webpack/_production.js`.\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n\r\nBasic project configuration can be found in `~/config/_base.js`. Here you'll be able to redefine your `src` and `dist` directories, adjust compilation settings, tweak your vendor dependencies, and more. For the most part, you should be able to make changes in here **without ever having to touch the webpack build configuration**. If you need environment-specific overrides, create a file with the name of target `NODE_ENV` prefixed by an `_` in `~/config` (see `~/config/_production.js` for an example).\r\n\r\nCommon configuration options:\r\n\r\n* `dir_src` - application source code base path\r\n* `dir_dist` - path to build compiled application to\r\n* `server_host` - hostname for the Koa server\r\n* `server_port` - port for the Koa server\r\n* `compiler_css_modules` - whether or not to enable CSS modules\r\n* `compiler_source_maps` - whether or not to generate source maps\r\n* `compiler_vendor` - packages to separate into to the vendor bundle\r\n\r\nStructure\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe folder structure provided is only meant to serve as a guide, it is by no means prescriptive. It is something that has worked very well for me and my team, but use only what makes sense to you.\r\n\r\n```\r\n.\r\n├── bin                      # Build/Start scripts\r\n├── build                    # All build-related configuration\r\n│   └── webpack              # Environment-specific configuration files for webpack\r\n├── config                   # Project configuration settings\r\n├── custom_typings           # Custom TypeScript definitions\r\n├── server                   # Koa application (uses webpack middleware)\r\n│   └── main.js              # Server application entry point\r\n├── src                      # Application source code\r\n│   ├── components           # Generic React Components (generally Dumb components)\r\n│   ├── containers           # Components that provide context (e.g. Redux Provider)\r\n│   ├── layouts              # Components that dictate major page structure\r\n│   ├── redux                # Redux-specific pieces\r\n│   │   ├── modules          # Collections of reducers/constants/actions\r\n│   │   └── utils            # Redux-specific helpers\r\n│   ├── routes               # Application route definitions\r\n│   ├── static               # Static assets (not imported anywhere in source code)\r\n│   ├── styles               # Application-wide styles (generally settings)\r\n│   ├── views                # Components that live at a route\r\n│   └── main.tsx             # Application bootstrap and rendering\r\n└── tests                    # Unit tests\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Components vs. Views vs. Layouts\r\n\r\n**TL;DR:** They're all components.\r\n\r\nThis distinction may not be important for you, but as an explanation: A **Layout** is something that describes an entire page structure, such as a fixed navigation, viewport, sidebar, and footer. Most applications will probably only have one layout, but keeping these components separate makes their intent clear. **Views** are components that live at routes, and are generally rendered within a **Layout**. What this ends up meaning is that, with this structure, nearly everything inside of **Components** ends up being a dumb component.\r\n\r\nWebpack\r\n-------\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\nThe webpack compiler configuration is located in `~/build/webpack`. Here you'll find configurations for each environment; `development` and `production` exist out of the box.\r\n\r\n**Note**: There has been a conscious decision to keep development-specific configuration (such as hot-reloading) out of `.babelrc`. By doing this, it's possible to create cleaner development builds (such as for teams that have a `dev` -> `stage` -> `production` workflow) that don't, for example, constantly poll for HMR updates.\r\n\r\nSo why not just disable HMR? Well, as a further explanation, enabling `react-transform-hmr` in `.babelrc` but building the project without HMR enabled (think of running tests with `NODE_ENV=development` but without a dev server) causes errors to be thrown, so this decision also alleviates that issue.\r\n\r\n### Vendor Bundle\r\nYou can redefine which packages to bundle separately by modifying `compiler_vendor` in `~/config/_base.js`. These default to:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n[\r\n  'history',\r\n  'react',\r\n  'react-redux',\r\n  'react-router',\r\n  'redux-simple-router',\r\n  'redux'\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Webpack Root Resolve\r\nWebpack is configured to make use of [resolve.root](http://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#resolve-root), which lets you import local packages as if you were traversing from the root of your `~/src` directory. Here's an example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// current file: ~/src/views/some/nested/View.js\r\n\r\n// What used to be this:\r\nimport SomeComponent from '../../../components/SomeComponent'\r\n\r\n// Can now be this:\r\nimport SomeComponent from 'components/SomeComponent' // Hooray!\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Globals\r\n\r\nThese are global variables available to you anywhere in your source code. If you wish to modify them, they can be found as the `globals` key in `~/config/index.js`.\r\n\r\n* `process.env.NODE_ENV` - the active `NODE_ENV` when the build started\r\n* `__DEV__` - True when `process.env.NODE_ENV` is `development`\r\n* `__PROD__` - True when `process.env.NODE_ENV` is `production`\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the following variables are globally available by automatic imports (see section \"Globally available imports\" further below):\r\n\r\n* `React` (imported from `'react'`)\r\n* `ReactDOM` (imported from `'react-dom'`)\r\n\r\n### Provided Plugins\r\n\r\n#### Globally availabe imports via ProvidePlugin\r\n\r\nWebpack is configured to use [ProvidePlugin](https://webpack.github.io/docs/list-of-plugins.html#provideplugin), which lets you use commonly used imports without explicitly writing an import statement, reducing boilerplate. To add more automatic imports, add them to `compiler_globals` in `~/config/_base`. Additionally, add them to the globals object in your `.eslintrc` so you don't encounter misleading linter errors.\r\n\r\nServer\r\n------\r\n\r\n> **Note:** We're using Koa `^1.0.0` until `^2.0.0` stable is released. A lot of the middleware in Koa's ecosystem hasn't caught up yet, so even though async/await is awesome, `^1.0.0` will currently provide a better developer experience.\r\n\r\nThis starter kit comes packaged with an Koa server. It's important to note that the sole purpose of this server is to provide `webpack-dev-middleware` and `webpack-hot-middleware` for hot module replacement. Using a custom Koa app in place of [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) will hopefully make it easier for users to extend the starter kit to include functionality such as back-end API's, isomorphic/universal rendering, and more -- all without bloating the base boilerplate. Because of this, it should be noted that the provided server is **not** production-ready. If you're deploying to production, take a look at [the deployment section](#deployment).\r\n\r\nStyles\r\n------\r\n\r\nBoth `.scss` and `.css` file extensions are supported out of the box and are configured to use [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). After being imported, styles will be processed with [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) for minification and autoprefixing, and will be extracted to a `.css` file during production builds.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** If you're importing styles from a base styles directory (useful for generic, app-wide styles), you can make use of the `styles` alias, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// current file: ~/src/components/some/nested/component/index.jsx\r\nimport 'styles/core.scss' // this imports ~/src/styles/core.scss\r\n```\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this `styles` directory is aliased for sass imports, which further eliminates manual directory traversing; this is especially useful for importing variables/mixins.\r\n\r\nHere's an example:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n// current file: ~/src/styles/some/nested/style.scss\r\n// what used to be this (where base is ~/src/styles/_base.scss):\r\n@import '../../base';\r\n\r\n// can now be this:\r\n@import 'base';\r\n```\r\n\r\nTesting\r\n-------\r\n\r\nTo add a unit test, simply create a `.spec.js` file anywhere in `~/tests`. Karma will pick up on these files automatically, and Mocha and Chai will be available within your test without the need to import them.\r\n\r\nCoverage reports will be compiled to `~/coverage` by default. If you wish to change what reporters are used and where reports are compiled, you can do so by modifying `coverage_reporters` in `~/config/_base.js`.\r\n\r\nDeployment\r\n----------\r\n\r\nOut of the box, this starter kit is deployable by serving the `~/dist` folder generated by `npm run compile` (make sure to specify your target `NODE_ENV` as well). This project does not concern itself with the details of server-side rendering or API structure, since that demands an opinionated structure that makes it difficult to extend the starter kit. However, if you do need help with more advanced deployment strategies, here are a few tips:\r\n\r\nIf you are serving the application via a web server such as nginx, make sure to direct incoming routes to the root `~/dist/index.html` file and let react-router take care of the rest. The Koa server that comes with the starter kit is able to be extended to serve as an API or whatever else you need, but that's entirely up to you.\r\n\r\nHave more questions? Feel free to submit an issue or join the Gitter chat!\r\n\r\nTroubleshooting\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n### `npm run dev:nw` produces `cannot read location of undefined.`\r\n\r\nThis is most likely because the new window has been blocked by your popup blocker, so make sure it's disabled before trying again.\r\n\r\nReference: [issue 110](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit/issues/110)\r\n\r\n### High editor CPU usage after compilation\r\n\r\nWhile this is common to any sizable application, it's worth noting for those who may not know: if you happen to notice higher CPU usage in your editor after compiling the application, you may need to tell your editor not to process the dist folder. For example, in Sublime you can add:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t\"folder_exclude_patterns\": [\".svn\",\t\".git\",\t\".hg\", \"CVS\",\t\"node_modules\",\t\"dist\"]\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
